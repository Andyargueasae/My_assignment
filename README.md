>>>>>>> description: This aim of this project is to analyze and process the amount of data, in the form of text files or json files, and provide a summary for interpretation. From this project, the basic scoring information, the mentions of clubs from the English Premier League by media would be considered as raw data, to provide an outlook of the scores made by each team, the mentioning of each club by media, the co-existence of different clubs based on specialized similarity scores. Additionally, the relationship between the focus from media and the scores achieved for each team would also be explored. Secondly, the attempts to find matches of soccer scoring and the similarities between each article in a collection of articles would also be performed. 
>>>>>>> The application of the project is mainly in the text data processing.
>>>>>>>  The technique used to achieve the matches of soccer scores from articles data is based on pattern search using regular expression, while the appropriateness is challenged for the fact that it might produce irrelevant matches other than soccer scores.The visualizations of the results from each parts of the project are supported by matplotlib module from python. The similarities between the articles from the collection is calculated using the tfidf system, the tool is supported by TfidfTransformer. 
>>>>>>>  It is easy to handle this project, it is mainly composed of 9 python functions, each is labelled with correlating functionality, type the task with task number in the command while using it.
>>>>>>>  Finally, the challenges from the project include the inappropriate output from the task that finds the soccer matches from the collection of articles, hence the aim in the future is to implement more specified algorithm to avoid invalid matches.
